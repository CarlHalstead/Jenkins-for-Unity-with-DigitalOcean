# Jenkins for Unity with DigitalOcean

## Prerequisites

#### Required
* DigitalOcean account ($50 free credit with my [referral](https://m.do.co/c/7d4a120f8b9b))
* DigitalOcean Droplet (This is a Virtual Machine in the cloud which you can use as you wish. [I have found that you need at least 2GB to compile most Unity projects](https://forum.unity.com/threads/jenkins-ubuntu-executemethod-class-unitybuild-could-not-be-found.764132/))
* Registered domain (You can get one for free from Freenom)

#### Recommended
For those who are not quite as comfortable in the Linux environment just yet [I also recommend installing a VNC client](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-ubuntu-18-04) which will allow you to stream the video feed to your computer and interact with a GUI for the parts that you do not know off the top of your head in the terminal.
